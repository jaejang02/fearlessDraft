# League of Legends Fearless Drafting website

Explanation: Fearless drafting is different, competitive game mode in League of Legend's Summoner's Rift where champions picked in previous games can't be picked in the next. For example, if Team 1 picks a champion in game one, that same champion can't be picked in games 2, 3, etc...


Purpose: Because no website currently handles fearlessDrafting for League of Legends, this website is meant to create an easy-to-use application for the new game-mode.
